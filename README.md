Overview: 

UnearthWorks aims to provide a platform which systematically organizes and compiles online novels and ebooks so that users can easily search and access them. We are aiming for Vostok.

Nowadays, the online writing community is getting increasingly popular. Although there are many websites providing a platform for writers to write and share, there are no websites that compile and organize these precious resources online. Hence, many great works go undiscovered. 

Thus, UnearthWorks will solve this problem by organizing these novels in a systematic way, for example, according to different genres and authors etc, so that they can be accessed easily.

Features finished up to now:
We created a responsive layout of our homepage to our website with a top navigation bar and a left sidebar.
     

Planned features:

User Stories:
-As a user, I want to be able to search for stories based on my preference, for example, the most popular stories based on the highest votes.
-As a user, I want to be able to save my favourite stories, by being able to bookmark them, so that I can access them easily in future.
-As a user, I want to be able to comment and vote for the stories I like and dislike.

Based on the user stories, we hope to allow users to login into our website and vote for the stories they like. Users will then be able to look and find top stories on the website. 

Features for this sprint:
- Login with Facebook or Twitter
- Create the page layout for the information for a story
- Users can vote for the stories based on their likings
- Have a Top List based on the votings
